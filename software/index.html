<h3> Instructions for Browsing or Down-Loading </h3>

Click on a link.  If it's a plain file, the file will be displayed in your
borwser window.	 If it's a directory, a directory listing will be displayed. <p>

In the latter case, there will be a big bold link at the top:

<p> <center> <font size=+1> Download this directory </font> </center> <p>

If you click on this link, a script will be run in our server which
packages up and (optionally) compresses the software and squirts it down the line to you.
You will be asked what format you want.	 If you don't know, I sugges pkzip (if you're using a PC) or
gzipped tar (if you're runnng Unix). <p>

Finally, your browser will prompt you for a filename
(on your local system) and will store the package in that file.

<h3> Instructions for Uncompressing and Unpacking </h3>

<h4> Uncompressed tar: </h4>

Save the results locally in a file called (e.g.) <tt>temp.tar</tt>.
Unpack by

<pre>
    tar xf temp.tar
</pre>

This will create a new directory below your current directory,
containing the software.

<h4> Gnu zipped tar: </h4>

Save the results locally in a file called (e.g.) <tt>temp.tar.gz</tt>.
Uncompress and unpack by

<pre>
    gunzip temp.tar.gz
    tar xf temp.tar
</pre>

This will create a new directory below your current directory,
containing the software.

<h4> Compressed tar: </h4>

Save the results locally in a file called (e.g.) <tt>temp.tar.Z</tt>.
Uncompress and unpack by

<pre>
    uncompress temp.tar.Z
    tar xf temp.tar
</pre>

This will create a new directory below your current directory,
containing the software.

<h4> Zip: </h4>

Save the results locally in a file called (e.g.) <tt>temp.zip</tt>.
Uncompress and unzip by

<pre>
    unzip temp.zip
</pre>

This will create a new directory below your current directory,
containing the software. <p>

In case of difficulty, don't suffer in silence - <a href=mailto:fisher@minster.york.ac.uk> email me.</a> <p>

<h3> Technical Note </h3>

This directory implements ``Publishing on Demand'' for software packages.
All packages are held as zip files, which are unzipped by the server whenever
you request a package or a file within a package.  Similarly, when you click on
a ``download'' link, the server zips (or tars, compresses, gzips, etc) the file for you. <p>

The zip files are updated from their respective master directories each night in the wee small hours.
The master directories are on a separate machine and are not visible to the server, for security reasons. <p>

All this happens transparently to the user.  You just click on a link as usual.
The system has been thoroughly tested, but on only a small range of browsers.
If you have any problems whatsoever, please <a href=mailto:fisher@minster.york.ac.uk> let me know</a>
and I shall try to sort them out. <p>
