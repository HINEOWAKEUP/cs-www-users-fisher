This is Version ??? (?? ?? 1998).

   (*) The directory ``slow'' contains the source of the top-level program
       ``modem'' which handles fax output and the slow modem modes
       (V.21 and V.23).

   (*) The directory ``fast'' contains the source of the program ``fmodem''
       which handles the fast modem modes (V.32 bis).  At the moment,
       access to this directory is restricted.	Sorry about this.

The program uses ``fifi'', a filter-filter, which generates efficient
C++ code from a compact representation of a digital filter.
Fifi is "work in progress" which is not yet documented.
Email me for more details.

For further help, please contact me by email.
I'd also like to hear what you do and don't like about the package.
