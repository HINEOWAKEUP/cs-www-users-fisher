This directory contains some programs for converting between various
geographic coordinate systems - mainly between the UK Ordnance Survey and
spherical polar (latitude/longitude).  Note that the OS is a modified
transverse Mercator, so the routines ought to be adaptable to other TM
projections.

There are at least 3 approaches to this problem:

1.  Assume a spherical Earth.  This gives results that are way out:
    better than 96m in X and 3000m in Y, over almost all of the UK
    (worse in Shetland!).

2.  Use the spherical trig formulae, with "fudge factors" to account for
    the fact that the Earth is a spheroid, not a sphere (i.e. it's
    squashed).	This is the technique used in polos.c.	The results are
    accurate to better than 20m over almost all of the UK.

3.  Use the series expansion given in [1] (see refs. below).  This is
    fine - the results are accurate to about 2cm - but the method doesn't
    really give much clue about what is going on.  This might not matter
    to you.  This is the technique used in the Fortran 77 programs
    polar_os.f and os_polar.f.

I also have some routines for converting from hyperbolic coords to OS (TM),
and from hyperbolic to lat/long.  Email me if you're interested in these.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:  polar_os.f and os_polar.f - that's the accurate ones! -
		  are by C.P. Swan.
