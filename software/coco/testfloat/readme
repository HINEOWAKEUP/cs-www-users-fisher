Polar-to-OS conversion by the series method
===========================================

The programs are based on the series expansions given in [1-3], which are
almost universally used for these conversions.	The paper by Lee [4]
gives a derivation of the equations.

The results are accurate to better than 1mm for locations in the British Isles.
